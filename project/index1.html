		<div class="first-question" id="first-question"><br> <strong>What is Hour of Code?</strong> </div><br>
		<p id="first-paragraph">The Hour of Code is type of activity that basically introduce and describe <em>“code”</em> in computer science and explains the essential coding part visually that can easily be understood by individual. Gradually, it became global celebration in computer science field. More precisely, the hour of code starts with one hour of codding and people who interest in codding follow the steps in tutorial programs that are formed to be done in an hour and write codes. The tutorials are designed like a game and contain all the essential information that allows for an hour of fun. After finishing given tutorials of code hour, people get certificate of attendance and participation.</p>
		<div class="second-question"><strong>What is the purpose of Hour of Code?</strong></div>
		<p id="second-paragraph">Hour of Code does not require becoming expert computer scientist in one hour. This time period is enough to experience the fun side of Computer Science and being creative, that it is accessible at all ages, for all students, less of background. The measure of success of this campaign is not in how much CS students learn - the success is reflected in broad participation across gender, racial/ethnic, and socioeconomic groups, and the resulting increase in	enrollment and participation we see in CS courses at all grade levels. Millions of the participating teachers and students have decided to go beyond one hour - to learn for a whole day or a whole week or longer, and many students have decided to enroll in a whole course (or even a college major) as a result.</p>
